# Sorting algorithm visualizer



## Purpose
We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization.


Thats why we are making this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms work and through this project you also will get a deep understanding of such sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented
1) Bubble Sort
2) Insertion Sort
3) Selection Sort
4) Heap Sort

## Features

1) Control the size of randomly generated array
2) Control the visualization speed
3) Reset to original unsorted array
4) sorting array in ascending or descending order

##  How it works ?

Here in our webapp, each element value is represented by THE SIZE OF THE BAR and the algorithms sort them by placing the smallest elements on the left and the biggest elements on the right or vica versa.

The algorithms moves the items around by swapping elements, Without using any addational memory with creating another array.

## Features

1) Control the size of randomly generated array
2) Control the visualization speed
3) Reset to original unsorted array
4) sorting array in ascending or descending order

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Siddhantshelake/Sorting-algorithm-visualizer
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Sorting-algorithm-visualizer
```
